# LlamaBot Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**Version 1.0 – May 28, 2025**

In order to clarify the intellectual‑property license granted with contributions from any person or entity, **Kody Kendall, primary maintainer of the LlamaBot Project** ("**Project Owner**") must have a Contributor License Agreement ("**CLA**") on file that has been signed by each contributor, indicating agreement to the terms below. The purpose of this CLA is to protect both you as a contributor and the LlamaBot Project; it does **not** change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

By submitting a Contribution (defined below) to the LlamaBot Project, **You accept and agree** to the following terms and conditions for all present and future Contributions. Except for the licenses expressly granted to the Project Owner and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Owner, **You reserve all right, title, and interest** in and to Your Contributions.

## 1  Definitions

1. **"You" / "Your"** means the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is entering into this Agreement with the Project Owner. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered a single Contributor. "Control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise; or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50 %) or more of the outstanding voting shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.
2. **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the LlamaBot Project in any form, for inclusion in, or documentation of, the project’s software, documentation, or other materials (collectively, the "**Work**"). "Submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project Owner or its representatives—including but not limited to communications on mailing lists, source‑code control systems, or issue trackers—excluding communication conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

For avoidance of doubt, **the Project Owner may sublicense, re‑license, dual‑license, or otherwise distribute the Contribution (in whole or in part) under any license terms now known or hereafter devised, and this license extends automatically to any successor, assignee, or acquirer of the Project Owner or of substantially all assets of the LlamaBot Project, without additional consent from You.**
