10.19.25:
- Refactor massive chat.html file into separate JavaScript & CSS packages.
- Create JavaScript modules for Chat, making it more understandable, maintainable, and ready to continue working towards React with TypeScript frontend
- Add frontend support for any model - Claude, Gemini, GPT Codex, or Traditional GPT series. Added extractTextContent method for this.
- Normalize file path arguments when LLM calls tools, so that there's less misses/tool arg formatting issues (less tool slippage = higher accuracy for LLM).
