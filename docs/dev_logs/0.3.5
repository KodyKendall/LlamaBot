0.3.5:
- [] Add JavaScript timer to track if the user is active on the /chat.html.erb homepage
- [x] Set Gemini 3.0 Flash as default model
- [] Add prompt library you can use to save prompts.
    - Question: What if you want to pull data out of the Rails database & format it? (it would be cool to pull that from the Rails Controller session variables somehow. or pass controller variables into the JavaScript somehow, and have it be able to inject that into the agent prompt.)
