0.1.14:

07/26/2025: 
- Feat: Stream AIMessageChunks in websocket request_handler (HTTP streaming, coming soon!)
- Feat: Add 'created_at' metadata for HumanMessage request_handler.py to automatically add time-stamps (makes it easier to sort message histories in front-end JavaScript)
- Feat: Add 'created_at' metadata for AIMessage agents#llamabot_v1#nodes and agents/llamapress/nodes to automatically add time-stamps
- Feat: Add support for Ollama for running locally on Mac in LlamaBot agent
- Bug fix: remove checkpointer setup() in main application. Now you must run `python init_pg_checkpointer.py` on app setup.
- Feat: Add support subgraph=True data shape in request_handler.py, in prepartion for supporting prebuilt create_react_agent and multi-agent supervisor agents.
- Feat: Add selected element tool call so the agent can modify just a small slice of a page.

07/28/2025:
- DX: Add better websocket disconnect error if it's 1000, it meant the client intentionally disconnected. Add better log.
- Bug: Wrap our tool call as async so that heartbeats can continue with the client & server.

07/30/2025:
- Refactor: LlamaPress into supervisor agent, and add html_agent and clone sub-agents
- Feat: Add url clone and image clone sub-agents
- Add private agent folder 

07/31/2025: 
- Patch requirements.txt that included a reference no longer needed (was breaking in production)

- fix!: drop Python 3.9-3.10 support, remove deprecated langgraph-api

BREAKING CHANGE: Python 3.11+ now required due to LangGraph dependencies

- Remove deprecated langgraph-api==0.2.110 (merged into main package) 
- Remove circular self-dependency line
- Update pyproject.toml to require Python >=3.11
- Keep langgraph-runtime-inmem (works fine with Python 3.11+)

Fixes installation failures on deployment.
