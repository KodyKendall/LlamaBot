- Route home page to the /chat page.

- TODO: Need to add playwright install into Dockerfile so playwright is in image by default. (Not working currently)

- Add a comment with placeholder iframe in chat.html for localhost:3000 where we'll be able to view an iFrame wrapping a Ruby on Rails application, so that Leonardo can build and iterate on Rails apps from within the LlamaBot chat interface.
- This plans for future relases where Leonardo will be able to develop Ruby Rails applications within the browser interface in a hosted environment. (Similar to Lovable, Bolt.new, Base44, etc.)
- (Starting with LlamaPress Ruby on Rails app, open source Rails project to LlamaBot)
