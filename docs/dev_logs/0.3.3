0.3.3a:
 - [x] Improve engineering mode prompts to use TODO tool more aggressively, and make sure ticket mode stays focused even if the user puts debug requests, or other non-ticket related requests in as it's initial message
 - [x] Move summarization message limit down to 8, because we had a run with 40 messages continuously re-triggering summarization on every turn.
 
0.3.3b:
 - [x] Add sections urging Ticket mode and Engineering mode to follow best rails conventions.
 - [x] Add more aggressive subtask delegation for large, complex tasks that span more entities and touch more parts of the codebase
