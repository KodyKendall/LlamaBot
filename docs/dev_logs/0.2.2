- Leonardo Improvements:
    - Tools: Add guard_against_beginning_slash_argument to prevent the agent from adding / to beginning of their argument.
    - Fix gh cli setup in Dockerfile to be architecture agnostic, and so Leonardo can use gh cli to push/pull code to user's Github repos and accounts after they've authenticated with gh-cli
    - Add named auth volume so auth.json info persists across container restarts
    - Set install_llamabot_local and install_llamabot_prod
    - Security: Allow for configuration of development.rb in production, so users can lock down their Rails app when deployed.
    - Authenticate with github. By going to rails.auth.llamapress.ai/users/sign_up, you can register, connect with Github, then give Leonardo your Github access token and he'll authenticate with your Github account. Perfect for creating a new repo with your Rails source code, pushing code changes to the repos, etc.

- Easy AWS Deployment Script:
    - Document the AWS CLI bash commands for quick deployments of Leonardo using AWS Lightsail + Route 53.
    - This is approximately $12/month of hosting costs from AWS, and assumes you have Route 53 configured for your domain, and assumes you have run `aws cli config` with a propery AMI user set up with permission for Route 53 and AWS Lightsail.
    - NOTE: You will need to modify AWS deploy script to change the hardcoded llamapress.ai. domain to point to your own Route 53 domain.
