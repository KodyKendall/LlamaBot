# LlamaBot Artifacts

This directory contains artifacts and projects generated by LlamaBot.

## Overview

Each artifact has one main `thread_id`, which corresponds to the LangGraph thread that was used to initialize and create this artifact.

## Project Structure

Each artifact project follows this standard structure:

```
artifact_project/
├── __init__.py
├── thread_id                    # File storing the thread_id that created this artifact
├── model.py                     # SQLModel definition for data persistence & ORM functionality
├── controller.py                # FastAPI routes to be consumed by script.html
├── templates/
│   └── page.html               # HTML page with Jinja templating generated by LlamaBot
└── static/
    ├── styles.css              # Styling for the page
    └── script.js               # JavaScript logic that interacts with backend via FastAPI routes
```
