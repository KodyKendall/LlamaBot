## ✨ What is LlamaBot?

**LlamaBot is an AI coding agent that generates working prototypes, embeds AI directly into the app, and runs real workflows — letting you move from idea to production in record time.** 

It works across the full spectrum of users:
- **Non-technical founders** who want to build without code.
- **Product teams** who need to spin up prototypes fast.
- **Engineers** who want an AI teammate to automate workflows inside production apps.

Unlike typical codegen tools, LlamaBot doesn’t just write snippets — it can **embed directly in your app and run real workflows.** This makes it ideal for collaborative software building: founders guide the vision, engineers stay in control, and AI fills the gap.

---

LlamaBot is built for moving ideas fast:
- 🚀 *Prototype an AI MVP in a weekend* — landing pages, user flows, backend logic, all scaffolded by AI.
- 🧪 *Experiment with workflows* — test reporting, notifications, automations directly inside your app.
- 👥 *Collaborate with teammates* — Bridge the gap between non-technical founders and engineering teams.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Run the interactive agent
```bash
# Only requirement: Docker + your OpenAI key
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... -p 8000:8000 kody06/llamabot-backend
```

Open your browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/chat
```

## 🔌 Embed in an Existing App (Rails first, others coming)

Today, Rails is the primary supported framework. With the [`llama_bot_rails`](https://github.com/kodykendall/llama_bot_rails) gem, you can:
- Call existing ActiveRecord models
- Trigger your real services, jobs, and routes
- Automate workflows with natural language

**Example use cases:**
- Refund a user and send SMS
- Generate a weekly revenue report
- Queue 100 Sidekiq jobs from chat

Future adapters: Django, Laravel, Node.js.

## 🧠 Under the Hood
- Built on **LangGraph** for multi-step agent workflows
- **FastAPI + WebSockets** for streaming real-time responses
- Scoped memory per conversation/session
- Can call external APIs or internal app methods via whitelisted routes
